## 2. Intro To DataFrame:
### Lab 1
#### Technical Accomplishments:
- Practice reading data with Apache Spark and perform some basic tranformation like `select`, `distinct`, `dropDuplicates`, `drop` and action like `count`

### Lab 2
#### Technical Accomplishments:
- Practice with Column and Row Class, practice some API like `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `substr`...

### Lab 3
#### Technical Accomplishments:
- Explore aggregate functions and temporal function
- Practice some tranformations: `withColumnRenamed`, `withColumn` to read and perform some basic ETL to explore the data
