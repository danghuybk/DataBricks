#### This repository stores my training course work on Databricks platform. It includes two parts:
- DataFrame Lab: 
  - Practiced read, write data using DataFrameReader and DataFrameWriter
  - Using DataFrame API, perform transformation and action to analyze data.
- Structured Streaming: 
  - Practiced read, write streams from file and messaging system Kafka using DataStreamReader and DataStreamWriter.
  - Using DataFrame API to perform ETL jobs.
  - Built a Twitter realtime data pipeline to get information like top most tweeted hashtag in last 5 minute and where they come from.
