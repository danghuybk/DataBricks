This repository stores my practice with Spark Structured Streaming on DataBricks platform. Including:
## 1. Practice Lab
### 1.1. Streaming Concepts Lab
- Stream data from a file and write it out to a distributed file system
- List and Stop active streams
### 1.2. Time Window Lab
- Use sliding windows to aggregate over chunks of data rather than all data
- Apply watermarking to throw away stale old data that you do not have space to keep
- Plot live graphs using display
### 1.3. Using Kafka Lab
- Establish a connection with Kafka and stream data
- Do some ETL jobs and time window function
## 2. Twitter Capstone
#### Technical Accomplishments:
- In this capstone project, I will use Structured Streaming to gain insight from streaming Twitter data.
#### Requirement:
- The executive team would like to have access to some key business metrics such as:
  - Most tweeted hashtag in last 5 minute window
  - A map of where tweets are coming from
